I created this script for some Tweaks in windows. In Windows Home, some features are by default disabled. You can enable those features by using these scripts.

Hyper-V.bat ‚û°Ô∏è By using this script you can enable hyper-v in Windows Home

GPedit.bat ‚û°Ô∏è By using this script you can enable group policy in Windows Home

Temp_File_remover.bat ‚û°Ô∏è By using this script you can remove all temporary files from your Windows Machines

Windows_Taskbar_Transparent.bat ‚û°Ô∏è By using this script you can make your Windows 10 Taskbar Transparent.

Enjoy üëç
